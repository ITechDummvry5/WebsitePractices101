Syntax Rules Of strings,
typeof 2          -->  output 'numbers'                                                     [See Js Lesson3  //TypeOF using]
typeof 'hello'    -->  output 'strings'                                                     [See Js Lesson3  //TypeOF using]
xample1 - 'Hello'               --> output 'Hello'                                          [See Js Lesson3  //Example 1]
xample2 - 'Hello' + 'World'     --> output 'HelloWorld'                                     [See Js Lesson3  //Example 2]
cause   -  Combine 2 or more string  in a bigger strings called Concatenation
xample3 - 'Hello' + 2           --> output 'Hello2'                                         [See Js Lesson3  //Example 3]
cause   -  The number 2 It Will automaticaly convert into strings  called Type Coercion
${}     - iNSERT Values directly at the string method Interpolation


Notes!,
Strings = Text
Numbers and Strings are different types of Values
Concatenation      -> Combine Strings Together
Type coercion      -> automatic type conversion
4 types of String  -> single quotes, double quotes, escape character , template strings
Character          -> it can be letter|number|symbol|escape character = \
Interpolation      -> insert a value directly into a string  special features of template Strings
Multi Line Strings -> another special features of template Strings


Demo Codes Pratical example,
Practical 1 Problem Output:  $20.957.99

cause    -> Operator precedence and JavaScript automatically converts numbers into strings
            Pstring1 + Pnumber1 becomes a string, then adding Pnumber2 results in string concatenation
            Result: $20.957.99
            [See Js Lesson3  //Practical 1 uncomment the Output1 and comment Output2]

solution -> Use order of operation by controlling it with brackets
            Pstring1 + (Pnumber1 + Pnumber2) Numbers are added first, then converted to a string
            Correct Result: $28.94
            [See Js Lesson3  //Practical 1 uncomment Output2 and comment Output1]

Practical 2:  Display "P2string1 (" + Pqty + ") : $" + result4A                  [See Js Lesson3  //Practical 2 using the  Output2A]

Practical 3 : 4 Ways To create a Strings                                         [See Js Lesson3  //Practical 3 Output3]

            - '..'  use single quotes - use reccomend Default                                    
            - ".."  use double quotes - use reccomend if the single quotes inside of the string  
            - \     use Escape character – used to include special characters inside a string, such as quotes, newlines, tabs, or backslashes.
            - `..`  use backticks = template strings (supports multi-line & ${} interpolation), \ escape character (special chars: \', \", \n, \t, \\).
          
Practical 4 : Its a Recommended method The Interpolation Method  more easy way compare to Practical 2 
            '${}' ex: `${P2string1} (${Pqty}): ${Pstring1} ${result6}`           [See Js Lesson3  //Practical 4  Output4] 
           

More Details In JavaScript,
What should we use to create a string?
1. Use '...' by default
2. If we need interpolation, multi-line strings use `...`
