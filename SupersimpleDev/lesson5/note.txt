Lesson 5 — VARIABLES
1️⃣ What is a variable?
A variable is a container used to store a value, such as a number or a string.
📌 Note: We can use a variable anywhere a value is allowed.

2️⃣ Syntax for creating a variable
Example: let v2 = 2;

Explanation:
let →   creates a new variable (alternative: const)
v2 →    variable name
= →     assigns a value
2 →     the value (number or string)
; →     ends the statement

3️⃣ Variable name rules / restrictions
    1. Cannot use reserved words
    ex : let let = 3; // ❌ Invalid
    2. Cannot start with a number
    ex : let 2name = 3; // ❌ Invalid
    3. Cannot use special characters
    ex : let !@#$ = 2; // ❌ Invalid

✅ Allowed special characters: $ (dollar sign), _ (underscore)
ex : let $name = "Charles";
ex : let _age = 14;

4️⃣ Assigning vs Re-assigning values
1. Assigning a value → giving a variable its first value
ex : let v2 = 2; // Assigning
2. Re-assigning a value → changing the value of an existing variable
ex : v2 = 5; // Re-assigning

5️⃣ Syntax rules for re-assigning
    1. Do NOT use let when re-assigning
    ex: let age = 10;
        age = 15; // ✅ Correct
    ex: ❌ Wrong: let age = 15; → you cannot redeclare an existing variable with let.
    
    2.The variable must already exist
    let score = 50;
    score = 100; // ✅ Correct
    score = 100; // ❌ Error if score not declared
    
    3.You cannot re-assign a const variable
    const pi = 3.14;
    pi = 3.1416; // ❌ Error: const cannot be changed

6️⃣ JavaScript Semicolon Insertion
Even if you forget to write a semicolon ;, JavaScript will automatically insert it at the end of a line.
⚠️ But this does not always work — always use semicolons to avoid errors.

7️⃣ When to use const
Use const if you know the variable will never change.

8️⃣ About var
var is the old way to declare variables in JavaScript.
Variables declared with var can be reassigned and re-declared.
var has function scope, not block scope, which can sometimes cause unexpected behavior.
