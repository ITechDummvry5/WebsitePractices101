Lesson 6 - BOOLEAN AND IF-STATEMENT

What is Booleans? 
ans : Is a anothe type  of Value it is TRUE & FALSE
ans : A Boolean value is represents whether something is true or false

Syntax Rules for Boolean
1.true  - not 'true' its not Boolean its string

Comparison Operators
> greater than
    ans: Checks if the left value is bigger than the right value.
< less than
    ans: Checks if the left value is smaller than the right value.
>= greater than or equal to 
    ans: Checks if the left value is greater than OR equal to the right value.
=== Strict Equal To
    ans: Checks if value AND data type are the same.
== equal to (Loose Equality)
    ans: Checks if values are equal, but ignores data type. it convert value
!== not equal to 
    ans: Checks if the values are NOT equal OR NOT the same type.
!== not equal to (loose) 
    ans: Checks if the values are NOT equal but it does NOT check the data type.
||  OR 
    ans: Atleat One Is True 
&&  And 
    ans: Both Must Be True

Order of Operations (Operator Precedence)
1. (...) are the Highest Priority
2.  * / Are done first 
3.  + - are done after 
4.  Comparison Operators  is the least 

Note: For Comparison Operators
ex: 5 + 3 > 6   // true
Math first:
    5 + 3 = 8
Then comparison:
    8 > 6 → true.

IF-STATEMENT
ans: lets us write multiple groups of code and then decide which code to run 

Syntax Rules OF IF-STATEMENT
1.Basic if Syntax
if (condition) {
    // code runs if condition is true, IT Called 1Branches
}

ex : let age = 18;
if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("You are an adult");  
}

2.if...else
if (condition) {
    // runs if true,     IT Called 1Branches
} else {
    // runs if false,    IT Called 2Branches
}

ex : let age = 16;
if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("Adult");
} else {
    console.log("Minor");
}

3.if...else if...else
if (condition1) {
    // code,            IT Called 1Branches
} else if (condition2) {
    // code,            IT Called 2Branches
} else {
    // code,            IT Called 3Branches 1fallback
}

ex :  let score = 85;
if (score >= 90) {
    console.log("Grade A");
} else if (score >= 70) {
    console.log("Grade B");
} else {
    console.log("Grade C");
}

Key Points About Branches
Each branch is mutually exclusive — only one branch executes per if statement.
You can have multiple else if branches, but only one else Fallback.
Branches can contain any code, including nested if statements.
