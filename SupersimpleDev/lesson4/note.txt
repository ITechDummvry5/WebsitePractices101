HTML CSS Js

Trivia :
         []        means i have example in exercises.js
         No01      means Example
         //!       means NOTE: This code is currently commented out
         [EX]      means Start Of exercises
         {Customn} means I Have My own Code


No0  --> Inline Onclick Using
No01 --> same function as No0 But seperate JS and clean  //!
No02 --> A better Way or Most Recommended
