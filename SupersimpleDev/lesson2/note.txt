Numbers and Math Lesson2

Syntax rule numbers : 

xample
console : 10.90 * 2 + 20.95 
                        --> see exercisesjs lesson2  //example1
xample2
console : jstotal + 4.99 
                        --> See exercisesjs lesson2  //with shipping fee

Order Operation? 
ans : in javascript  it called (Operator Precedence)
* / Are done first 
+ - are done after 

more details: 
=Multiplication * and Division / → evaluated FIRST (left to right if multiple)
same Priority example : 2 * 3 / 5  Left -> right

=Addition + and Subtraction - → evaluated AFTER * and / (left to right)
same Priority example : 2 + 4 - 5 Left -> right

problem and solution:
cause : not controlled because of the rule of Order Operation
Solution : We can use (...) Brackets to control which part gets done first

Syntax Rules for Brackets? 
(...) are the Highest Priority
* / Are done first 
+ - are done after 

Terminology: Numbers and Operations
ans: in programming : 2,3,4 = integers  2.2,2.5 = Floating Point numbers (floats)
ans: computers have a problem working with floats
ans: Computers can store => 0.1
ans: Humans can store -> 0,1,2,...,8,9

More Detail In Math and Numbers 
1. Weird Behavior of math in javascript

details :  Human 2 , 99 ,, 0.2  | Computer 10 , 1100011 , ???? 
notes  :   computers cant Store Floats Properly 
notes2 :   this doesnt happen on all Floats
notes3 :   calculation with floats are sometimes inaccurate

solution to this problem : we can counting in cents instead dollar
                                        --> See exercisesjs lesson2 //example Counting in cent instead of dollar (Floats Solution) using example 2


2. How To round a Number? 

xample3 
console : Math.round(2.2) //Output 2 
console : Math.round(2.8) //Output 3
                            --> see exercisesjs lesson2 //example  cent calculating tax  percentages using example 2

3. How To Convert Celceius to Fahrenheit  or Fahrenheit to Celceius

• Fahrenheit = (Celsius * 9/ 5) + 32
•Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9
                            --> see exercisesjs lesson2 //   Convert F To C  Or C to F
